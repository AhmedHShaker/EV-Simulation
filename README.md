# EV-Simulation
## Overview
Welcome to the EV-Battery-Swapping project! This simulation project offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Shared Autonomous Electric Vehicles (SAEVs) and their charging infrastructure. With this project, you can explore and analyze the operations of a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles that provide on-demand transportation services.

## About the Model
* **SAEV Fleet Model:** The SAEV fleet is modeled after the specifications of a Tesla Model 3, taking into account the average charge consumption rate and maximum battery capacity.

* **Grid Structure:** The simulation utilizes a square-shaped grid, with each Cell measuring 0.25 miles by 0.25 miles. The grid is divided into two circular regions: Downtown (center) and Suburban (outer). Each region has distinct characteristics, including vehicle travel speed and trip generation rate.

* **Charging Stations (CS):** Each CS is equipped with a pre-determined number of Chargers, each capable of serving a single SAEV at a time.

## Simulation Parameters
To allow for the simulation of various scenarios, key parameters can be modified in the ```constants.py``` file. These parameters include:

* The number of grid cells
* The fleet size (number of cars)
* The number of charging stations
* Charger count at each station
* Trip generation rates for each cell in downtown and suburban areas
* Vehicle speed
* And much more

## Simulation
The simulation is powered by the SimPy framework, a tool for creating process-based discrete-event simulations. It models the multi-agent interactions of SAEVs, Charging Stations, and user trips. Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works:

1) **Initialization:** Before the SAEV simulation begins, the charging infrastructure is dynamically generated with a pre-defined number of Chargers. The SAEVs are distributed randomly on the grid.

2) **SAEV Fleet Simulation:** The simulation consists of two main processes:
   * **SAEV Selection:** Determining the most suitable SAEVs to serve user trips.
   * **Charging Strategy:** Identifying optimal CSs for recharging, taking into account proximity and queue time.
